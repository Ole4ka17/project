        Nevada is the state in the southwestern United States. It shares its borders with Oregon and Idaho to the north, Utah to the east, Arizona to the southeast, and California to the west. Most of Nevada’s land is made up of deserts and dry plains, since it sits in the Great Basin region.

        Nevada is the seventh-largest state in the U.S. by land area, but not many people actually live there. In fact, about three-quarters of the state’s residents are concentrated in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. Known as the “Silver State,” Nevada joined the Union back in 1864 and has long been famous for its rich mineral resources, especially silver. Some of its most well-known landmarks include Lake Tahoe, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Hoover Dam, and Lake Mead.

        Nevada has a mostly desert and semi-arid climate, making it one of the driest states in the U.S. Summers are hot, especially in southern areas like Las Vegas, where temperatures often exceed 100°F (38°C). Winters can be cold, particularly in the north and higher elevations, with snowfall common in places like Reno and Lake Tahoe. The state gets very little rainfall overall, with most precipitation falling in the winter months. Despite the dry conditions, Nevada's climate allows for clear skies, low humidity, and a wide range of outdoor activities year-round.
